im gonna make this readme look nicer later

thoughts so far:

omg

why is this so much work

artists complain about not getting paid for work but im over here having put at LEAST 60 hours into this without getting a single penny OR the right to complain

just for a stupid little fire emblem 1v1 thing

also, ppl are probably gonna be like "hey can u make this shitty program work better"

## aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

To Do List:
- [ ] Turn individual stats into a single stat array (this is gonna involve so much cleanup omg).
- [ ] Make everything NOT revolve around the Unit lol (more of a quality-of-life fix than anything).
